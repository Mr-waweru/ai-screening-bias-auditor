# AI Screening Bias Auditor 

## Introduction & Problem Statement


AI Screening Bias Auditor is a Generative AI–powered system designed to detect, measure, and report bias in AI-based resume screening tools. As organizations increasingly adopt automated hiring systems, concerns have grown about algorithmic discrimination, where candidates may be unfairly rejected due to gender, race, age, religion, or geographic origin; even when these attributes are not explicitly provided. This project addresses that challenge by building an automated, multi-agent auditing system that evaluates how fair and unbiased AI hiring tools truly are.
The project leverages Generative AI, Jaclang architecture, and byLLM workflows to generate counterfactual resumes, run them through target screening systems, measure bias, and generate interpretable audit reports.
